"""
I noticed that the results of the reference version and my previous version are different. After analysis, I found that the regex pattern needs to be more precise to avoid false matches. Here's my optimization strategy:

1. Use a more precise regex pattern to ensure accurate matching
2. Use collections.Counter for counting - it's optimized for this purpose
3. Read file in chunks for better I/O performance
4. Pre-compile regex pattern outside the loop
5. Use defaultdict to eliminate conditional checking for dictionary keys

The optimization focuses on both accuracy and performance:
- Improved regex pattern for accurate matching
- Efficient data structures
- Better I/O handling
