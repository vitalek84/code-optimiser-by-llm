"""
I noticed that the results of the reference version and my previous version are different. After analysis, I found that the regex pattern was not strict enough and was capturing some incorrect request types. Here's my optimization strategy:

1. Use a more precise regex pattern to ensure correct request type extraction
2. Use collections.defaultdict to eliminate the conditional check for dictionary initialization
3. Use mmap for memory-mapped file I/O which can be faster for large files
4. Pre-compile the regex pattern outside the loop for better performance
5. Use str.startswith() check to quickly filter out lines that don't start with valid requests
