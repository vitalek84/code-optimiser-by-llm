The current implementation can be optimized by leveraging some techniques to enhance the I/O performance and data handling. We can apply the following approaches:
1. Use a more efficient way to iterate over file lines using the built-in `collections.Counter` data structure to handle counting in a more performant manner.
2. We will make use of the `with` block to ensure the file is opened and closed properly, but iterate over its lines using a try-finally block to avoid unnecessary overhead.
3. Improve memory and speed efficiency of the dictionary update operations using `Counter`.
4. Retain the regular expression and sorting mechanisms as they seem necessary for the specific task and are performant.
