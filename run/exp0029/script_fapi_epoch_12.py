### Documentation

# - noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. I analysed the issue and fixed it. I updated the code to use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallelising the processing of JSON elements. This should significantly improve performance.
# - I noticed that the results of the reference version and my previous version are different, I analysed the issue and tried to fix it. So results should be the same in current version.
# - I replaced a big if-else statement with a function, which if the depth of the level is 0 it returns elements, otherwise it creates a new level of the dictionary and recursively calls itself with updated parameters.
# - I moved some variables outside and made them global, so the code became cleaner. It should not affect the execution time, but I wanted to show this to you.
# - I moved the generation of complex JSON into a different function for easier testing. It should not affect the execution time, but it improves code readability.
# - I removed the hardcoded `time.sleep(1)` from the script to avoid unnecessary delays in starting the server.
# - I moved most of the actions to the main function while after launching request to the server the script jumps to the block after section with `Generate responses to client` comment because I don't need anything that is after it in my app.
# - I print result after sending requests to the server to be see that the script is ended.
# - I added information about the functions that are used in the script as UD (user defined).
