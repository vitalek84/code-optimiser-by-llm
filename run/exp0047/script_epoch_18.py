I noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. I analysed the issue and fixed it.
Also I understand that I shouldnâ€™t take to account execution time of not working version.

In this new version, I will use a more efficient way to count occurrences by utilizing 
collections.Counter which is optimized for such operations. Additionally, I'll read 
the entire file at once instead of reading line by line, and use list comprehensions 
for better performance.
