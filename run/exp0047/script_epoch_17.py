I noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. I analysed the issue and fixed it. Also, I understand that I shouldnâ€™t take into account execution time of not working version.
To improve performance, I'll use a more efficient way to count request types using collections.Counter. Additionally, I'll compile the regular expression outside the loop to avoid recompilation on each iteration.
