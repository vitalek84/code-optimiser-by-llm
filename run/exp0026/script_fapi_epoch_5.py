"""
To optimize the previous FastAPI application, I aim to reduce the execution
time by taking advantage of the concurrent nature of the server and reducing
the processing complexity where feasible. 

1. Replace nested loops with a recursive function for cleaner and potentially
   more efficient processing.
2. Removed any global state that doesn't need to be reset per request.
   The `internal_dict` doesn't need resetting, just needs to be local to each request.
3. Eliminated unnecessary sleep time, as FastAPI with Uvicorn is usually fast enough to start serving requests.
4. Stopped printing `Done.` since it's not used to measure processing time and serves no purpose in a performance reduction initiative.
5. Implemented asynchronous features efficiently using async I/O. However, requests to the server are still sync due to dependency on the `requests` package. This may be changed with `httpx` for asynchronous requests, should further iterations show need.
