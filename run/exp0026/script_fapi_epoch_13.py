I noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. I analysed the issue and fixed it. Also I understand that I shouldnâ€™t take to account execution time of not working version.
To optimize the current implementation, I will avoid re-running the server for each request as it seems redundant and time-consuming. The server should ideally run independently and process requests continuously. I'll structure the code to demonstrate this by creating a main entry point that initializes and processes through requests without stopping and restarting the server. 

Other optimizations I intend to implement:
1. Using `httpx` library instead of `requests` to handle asynchronous requests more efficiently.
2. Utilizing the latest features and best practices of FastAPI and uvicorn.
3. Avoiding global variables where possible and using context management to keep the code cleaner.
