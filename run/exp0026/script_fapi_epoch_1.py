I noticed that the results of the reference version and my previous version are different, 
I analysed the issue and tried to fix it. So results should be the same in the current version.

1. The previous error was due to trying to use a list as a key, which is unhashable. 
   I analyzed and fixed this issue by ensuring nested dictionary keys are always strings.

2. I optimized nested loop operations by minimizing the manipulation of keys.
   Unnecessary string interpolation operations have been reduced.

3. Nested level computations are now replaced by an encapsulated function call instead of nesting the loops inline. 
   This reduces the complexity in the main function flow and enhances readability.

4. Added setdefault to the dictionary update for efficiency as it reduces the number of lookups.
