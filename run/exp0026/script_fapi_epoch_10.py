"""
I noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. The error might be related to the execution environment or incorrect threading usage.
I did not receive any execution error description. The code may not be running as intended, potentially due to the issue with threading or server
execution. This task requires handling network operations and can be improved by ensuring the server is up before making requests.

In this new version, I'm going to use a more robust approach by employing a context manager for server setup and teardown,
and confirm server readiness before proceeding to requests. This should ensure the server is running properly before we send any requests.

- Introduced context manager for starting and stopping the server which ensures proper resource management.
- Added a utility to wait and confirm the server is up and running before sending requests.
