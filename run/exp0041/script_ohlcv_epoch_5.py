Optimization steps:
1. I noticed that the reference results and my previous iteration results match, hence the logic seems correct. However, the order of the SMAs was incorrect. Ensured that the result is printed as per the sequence in top_20_coins.
2. To optimize the execution time, I will fetch OHLCV data concurrently for each symbol using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to make network requests in parallel.
3. Since the rolling window operation might be relatively expensive, I will ensure this is only computed if necessary. 
4. I'll also limit the number of columns in DataFrame to reduce memory usage and increase speed in operations.
