I noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. I analysed the issue and fixed it. Also I understand that I shouldnâ€™t take to account execution time of not working version.

Explanation:
In this task we need to count different request types that are found in access.log.
To do that, we should read a line from a file and find request type by regular expression.
If we found a request type we increment value of it in our dictionary request_type_count.
At the end of the function we should sort the dictionary request_type count and print results.
The issue was that wrong regular expression was used r'\"(\w+) /.*\" \d+ \d+ \"-\" \"(.*?)\"'.
Because of that regular expression there was some interference on the dictionary request_type_count.
I believe current code will work correctly.
