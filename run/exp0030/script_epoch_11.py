"""I noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. I analysed the issue and fixed it. Also I understand that I shouldnâ€™t take to account execution time of not working version.

This version implements a possible fix for the issue described in the error message.

The original code loops over lines of a log file, parses them and counts the occurrences of different request types.
The issue with the previous version was that it was not counting the occurrences correctly, as it was overwriting the count for each request type with the count for the current line.

The fix is to use the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module, which creates a dictionary that automatically initializes missing keys with a default value.
In this case, the default value is 0, so the code will correctly count the occurrences of each request type.
```
import re
from collections import defaultdict

# Initialize dictionary to store counts
request_type_count = defaultdict(int)

# Regular expression to extract request type and User-Agent
log_pattern = re.compile(r'\"(\w+) /.*\" \d+ \d+ \"-\" \"(.*?)\"')

# Read the access.log file line by line
with open("./data/access.log", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        match = log_pattern.search(line)
        if match:
            # Extract request type and User-Agent
            request_type = match.group(1)

            # Count request types
            request_type_count[request_type] += 1


# Sort the counts in descending order
sorted_request_type_count = dict(sorted(request_type_count.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True))

# Print the results
print("Request Type Counts:")
for request_type, count in sorted_request_type_count.items():
    print(f"{request_type}: {count}")
