I noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. I analysed the issue and fixed it. Also I understand that I shouldnâ€™t take to account execution time of not working version.
I tried to improve efficiency of the script by introducing two changes. 
First, the original script was using re.search, which we can replace with re.findall that will give us all matches at once.
Second, during the iteration over matches we can initialize the result dictionary with counts to 0 in order to get rid of if statement in the count increment block  which should be much faster.
