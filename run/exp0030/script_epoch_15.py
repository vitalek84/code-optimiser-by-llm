I noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. I analysed the issue and fixed it. Also I understand that I shouldnâ€™t take to account execution time of not working version

This script calculates request type counts in the access.log file.
It uses a regular expression to extract the request type and User-Agent from each line in the file.
The request type is then counted and stored in a dictionary.
The dictionary is sorted in descending order and the results are printed.
I expect that it will work faster because sorting the dictionary of structured items uses less space
