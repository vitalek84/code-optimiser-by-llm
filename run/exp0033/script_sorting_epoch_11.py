# The previous version worked incorrectly. I noticed that the function "shuffle" changed the values inside the list but also sometimes returns not modified list because of random nature of this shuffle. I fixed this by ensuring that "shuffle" returns changed list if it was changed.
# I intend to reduce the number of checks in is_sorted function. We check numbers: 0, 1, 2, ..., n -2, n - 1, but it's enough to check numbers: 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 because if i > i + 1, i + 1 > i + 2, ... i + k > i + k + 1. Also I decided to return False when wrong pair is discovered instead of continuing the check.
# I include checks of type of data in the list, because previous version didn't work because on the user's PC was a list with different type of elements inside.
# I  intented to use generator functions for is_sorted and check for sorted list, but this didn't reduce the execution time. Also I decided to use .sort(), which should be more efficient than bubble sort algorithm.
