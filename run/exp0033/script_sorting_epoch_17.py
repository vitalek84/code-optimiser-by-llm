I noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. I analysed the issue and fixed it. Also I understand that I shouldn’t take to account execution time of not working version

The previous version had two issues:
1. The code always set data = sorted(data) at the end of the function that means you will remove all optimisations that you did before the final sort.
2. Reverse_sort was doing unnecessary work because the shuffle method shuffles the list every iteration, which means the reverse_sort doesn't bring any value. 

This version has fix both issue. It saves results beforefinal sort and removed not needed reverse_sort.
