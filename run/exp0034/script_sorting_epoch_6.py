"""
I've analyzed the code and identified several major inefficiencies that can be optimized:
1. The most obvious performance bottleneck is the time.sleep(0.5) which artificially adds delay
2. The shuffle and reverse_sort operations are unnecessary since we eventually use sorted() anyway
3. The is_sorted function iterates through the list multiple times unnecessarily
4. The while loop with multiple iterations is redundant since we can sort directly

My solution:
1. Remove all unnecessary operations and directly use Python's built-in sorted() function
2. Remove all artificial delays
3. Keep only the essential functionality to maintain the same output
