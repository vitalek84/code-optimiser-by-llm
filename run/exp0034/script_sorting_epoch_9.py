To optimize this script, I'll make the following changes:
1. Remove artificial time.sleep() delay which adds unnecessary 0.5s per iteration
2. Remove inefficient reverse_sort since it's not needed for final result
3. Remove shuffle operation since it's also not contributing to final result
4. Use the built-in sorted() function directly since that's what happens in the end anyway
5. Remove is_sorted check since we're using sorted() directly
6. Remove all the intensity and iteration tracking since they're no longer needed

The key insight is that all the random shuffling and reverse sorting are just artificial delays 
that don't contribute to the final sorted result. We can get the same correct output much faster
by using Python's built-in sorted() function directly.
