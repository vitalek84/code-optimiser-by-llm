"""
My thoughts on optimization:
1. The main bottleneck is the time.sleep(0.5) which adds artificial delay
2. The entire algorithm is inefficient by design, with multiple unnecessary operations
3. Since the goal is to sort the list, we can replace everything with a simple sorted() function
4. The reference results show we just need a sorted list in ascending order
5. We can completely remove all the unnecessary functions and logic

The optimized version will:
- Remove all unnecessary functions (is_sorted, shuffle, reverse_sort)
- Remove all artificial delays
- Use Python's built-in sorted() function directly
- Keep only the essential logic to maintain the same output
