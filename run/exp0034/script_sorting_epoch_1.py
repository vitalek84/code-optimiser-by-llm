"""
Optimization steps for this iteration:
1. The most obvious performance issue is the time.sleep(0.5) which adds unnecessary delay
2. The shuffle and reverse_sort operations are completely unnecessary since we have sorted() function
3. The is_sorted check can be optimized using zip() to avoid explicit indexing
4. We can remove the intensity calculations as they don't contribute to the actual sorting
5. Since the task is to sort numbers, we can use the built-in sorted() function directly
6. Removed all commented print statements to reduce code size
