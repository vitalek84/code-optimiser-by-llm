"""
This is my first optimization attempt. Here's my chain of thought for improvements:
1. The most obvious performance bottleneck is the time.sleep(0.5) which adds unnecessary delay
2. The shuffle and reverse_sort operations are completely unnecessary since we end up using sorted() anyway
3. The is_sorted check can be eliminated since we know we'll just use sorted()
4. We can directly return the sorted list using Python's built-in sorted() function
5. The intensity and iteration tracking are not needed since we're not using the inefficient approach anymore

This version should be significantly faster while producing the exact same results.
