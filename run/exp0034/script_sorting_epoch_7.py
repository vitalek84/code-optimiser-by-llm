"""
To optimize this script, I will make the following improvements:
1. Remove the unnecessary time.sleep() which adds artificial delay
2. Replace the inefficient bubble sort with Python's built-in sorted()
3. Remove unnecessary shuffle and reverse sort operations
4. Simplify the code by removing redundant checks and iterations
5. Use list.sort() instead of sorted() for in-place sorting to avoid creating new lists

The main optimization comes from removing the intentional inefficiencies that were 
built into the original script. Since the goal is to sort the list, we can do it
directly without the random shuffling and reverse sorting steps.
