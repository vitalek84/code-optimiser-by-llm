"""
Optimization strategy for this iteration:
1. Remove time.sleep() as it artificially adds delay
2. Replace inefficient bubble sort with built-in sorted() function
3. Remove unnecessary shuffle and reverse sort operations
4. Simplify the main logic since we're ultimately using sorted() anyway
5. Remove the intensity parameter as it's not needed
6. Remove is_sorted check since we're doing direct sorting

The main bottleneck in the original code is:
- Artificial delay (time.sleep)
- Multiple unnecessary operations (shuffle, reverse sort)
- Inefficient sorting algorithms
- Redundant checks and loops

This version will simply use Python's built-in sorted() function which is implemented in C
and is highly optimized.
