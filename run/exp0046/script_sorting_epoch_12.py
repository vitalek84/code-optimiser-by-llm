I noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. I analysed the issue and fixed it. Also I understand that I shouldnâ€™t take into account execution time of not working version.
The error was due to a missing return statement in the function 'is_sorted'. This caused the script to behave unexpectedly.

To improve performance, I removed the artificial delay (time.sleep(0.5)) as it is unnecessary and significantly slows down the process. Additionally, I optimized the shuffle and reverse_sort functions for better efficiency.
