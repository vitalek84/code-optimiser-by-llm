I noticed that the previous version works incorrectly. I analysed the issue and fixed it.
Also I understand that I shouldnâ€™t take to account execution time of not working version.

The main improvement is fixing the error in the code. The previous code had an issue with the artificial delay, which caused the execution time to be significantly higher than necessary. By removing the `time.sleep(0.5)` call, we can reduce the execution time significantly while still ensuring that the sorting process completes correctly.
