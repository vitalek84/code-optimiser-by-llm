The previous code includes an inefficient sorting method which involves shuffling, and reverse sorting with an artificial delay, leading to long execution times. Since both the reference and the previous versions of the code produce the correct results, I will focus on removing unnecessary steps to reduce execution time significantly.

1. Removed artificial time delay (time.sleep).
2. Eliminated inefficient functions (shuffle, reverse_sort) and the while loop entirely because they don't meaningfully contribute to sorting correctly and only add artificial delay.
3. Directly sort the list using Python's built-in sorted function, which is highly optimized.
