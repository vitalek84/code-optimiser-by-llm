Observations:
1. The previous version of the code is extremely inefficient due to unnecessary complexity, shuffling, reverse sorting, and artificial delays.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function to achieve an efficient sort.
2. Remove unnecessary functions `is_sorted`, `shuffle`, and `reverse_sort` as they contribute to inefficiency.
3. Eliminate time-consuming operations such as the artificial delay and unnecessary iterations.
4. Return the sorted data directly.

This approach should drastically reduce execution time by simplifying and efficiently sorting the list.
