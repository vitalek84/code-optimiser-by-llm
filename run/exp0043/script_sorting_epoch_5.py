I have noticed that the previous version had a very high execution time, mainly due to the use of time.sleep(0.5) which is an unnecessary delay in the process. 
To improve execution time, the first and immediate step is to remove the time.sleep() which is causing a deliberate delay. 
I will also remove the reverse_sort since it doesn't contribute effectively to achieving a sorted order, 
especially when combined with the shuffle method. Removing these inefficiencies should drastically reduce execution time while maintaining the correctness of the sorting.
