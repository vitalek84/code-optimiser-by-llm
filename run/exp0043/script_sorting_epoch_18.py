I noticed that the previous version contained unnecessary complexity with the `shuffle` and `reverse_sort`
functions and an artificial delay, which are not needed for an efficient sort. The whole sorting process could
be significantly optimized by simply using Python's built-in `sorted` function, which is highly efficient.
This modification should drastically reduce execution time while ensuring the correctness of results, maintaining
the expected sorted order. Therefore, I've eliminated unnecessary calls and directly returned the sorted list.
