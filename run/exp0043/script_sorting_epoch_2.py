"""
In the base version, the code has an inefficient mechanism that involves excessive random shuffling and deliberate delays. This contributes significantly to the lengthy execution time. Aim to reduce execution time by eliminating these inefficiencies. Specifically: 1) Remove the artificial delay introduced with time.sleep(0.5). 2) Completely eliminate the reverse_sort function as it is not contributing effectively. 3) Retain the fallback to sorted(data) at the end for ensuring sorting. These changes should significantly reduce execution time while maintaining correctness.
