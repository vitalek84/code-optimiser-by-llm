In the initial version, the script was highly inefficient due to the use of multiple unnecessary operations,
such as shuffling and reverse sorting, combined with delays, making the process very slow.
To optimize the execution time, I will remove the unnecessary reverse sorting and delay operation.
Further, instead of trying to sort using random shuffles, I will directly sort the list using Python's
built-in `sorted()` function, which is highly efficient. 
This should drastically reduce execution time as it avoids the iterative and inefficient process
previously deployed.
