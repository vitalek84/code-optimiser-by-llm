In the provided version of the code, the execution time is primarily spent in the shuffle, reverse sort, 
and the artificial time delay (sleep) that are intentionally inefficient. 
My first improvement will focus on implementing a more efficient sorting algorithm right away 
instead of relying on high-intensity shuffling and delay.

I will replace the entire process with Python's built-in `sorted` function, 
which is implemented using Timsort, an efficient hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort.
This change will eliminate the intentional inefficiencies and significantly reduce the execution time.
